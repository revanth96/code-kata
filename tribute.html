                        Raja Raja chola ( 985 – 1014 AD ) was one of the greatest emperors of the Chola dynasty. By
                        birth he
                        was
                        known as Arulmozhi Verman, the third son of Parantaka
                        Sundar Chola. He was trained to be a warrior to lead the cholan army in conquest against the
                        Pandya
                        and
                        Sinhalese kingdoms. Aditya Chola II, the eldest son was murdered under suspicious circumstances.
                        The theory is that he was murdered by the concubines with snake venom while engaging in an orgy
                        session.
                        This was a conspiracy hatched by the vanquished Pandyan King supporters ( Vira Pandya ) whose
                        beheaded
                        skull he paraded on the streets. He was succeeded out of turn by Uttama Chola ahead of
                        Arulmozhi.
                        This
                        was under a explicit understanding that the paternal uncle will be succeeded not by his son but
                        by
                        Arulmozhi ( Raja Raja Chola ) But eventually blood is thicker than water, as years went by the
                        promise
                        was conveniently brushed aside.
                        When he came to know regarding the conspiracy, he adopted the same trick with the help of his
                        guru
                        Bradbahu. The uncle and nephew were got rid of by the concubines dishing out drinks laced with
                        poison.

                        Raja Raja Chola was constantly engaged in battle with Chalukyas in the north, Pandyas in the
                        South
                        and
                        Sinhalese across the shore. One day while he was engaging in the battle inSri Lanka, he saw huge
                        statues
                        of Buddha.
                        He was inspired by this beautiful statue to dedicate theBrideshwarTempleto his family deity
                        Shiva @
                        Thanjavur. He commissioned the construction of the huge temple in 1004 AD.
                        Since the scale of construction was unparalleled in the history of temple construction, it took
                        almost 3
                        decades and it was completed by his Son Rajendra Chola in the year 1034 AD. Rajendra chola (
                        1014 –
                        1044
                        AD ) credited the construction in his dads name even though majority of the construction was
                        undertaken
                        by his patronage.

                        The temple complex was built on the banks of the river cauvery, with its water diverted to the
                        moat.
                        The
                        walls around the temple was constructed in the form of fortress, to protect the temple from
                        invaders.
                        Even today the temple has one of the highest gopuram ( 66 meters – 216 feet ) inIndia. The
                        Kalash (
                        shikara ) which is installed on top of the Vimana weighs a massive 81.5 tonnes. A ramp was
                        constructed
                        from 6 kms away from the temple complex to roll over the huge shikara on to the gopuram. The
                        entire
                        temple is built with granite which was not available in the area. Probably it was transported
                        from
                        Trichy Rockfort area which is located 40 kms away. The inspiration to create the magnificient
                        edifice
                        seems to have been inspired by the Chalukyan architecture. The gurus advice to atone for the
                        sins in
                        the
                        form of bloodshed of his rivals to the throne, by building an edifice to Lord Shiva.

                        It is alleged that more stones than the pyramid of Giza was transported to build this
                        magnificient
                        edifice dedicated to Lord Shiva.
